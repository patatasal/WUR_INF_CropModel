# WUR_INF_CropModel
This repository stores my works during my master's research practice project, which was done at the Information Technology group in Wageningen University &amp; Research, 2023-2024. This project only serves for studying purpose in WUR. 

If you are interested to try the whole project process yourself, please download all the files and run the Python scripts with "Stepxx" as filenames one by one. Please change the working directory in the scripts when applicable. 

For Step 1, you need to download and use the DNDC programme (https://www.dndc.sr.unh.edu/) to be able to generate the sample data. It is possible to skip Step 1 (data generation and pre-processing) and start from Step 2, since the relevant data files have been generated and provided already. 

Step 2 and 3 are model trains. you can try to train and adjust the model by yourself based on my script. Do you want to skip the model train and play with the prediction function directly? This is also possible since two trained example models have been provided in this repository. Then you can start directly from Step 5. 

Note that this is a preliminary student project done within four months and the datasets used here are mainly mock data for learning, experimenting and testing.
